            <h3 id="aim">Aim:</h3>
            <p>In this sprint I want to fix some more of the major problems that occured in sprint 2. Therefore the aim for sprint 4, is create functions to validate string entrys so the program won't crash. 
            <br> I need to make a function which properly validates the entry of strings. For instance, when the user is asked to pick a letter from the menu as well. Secondary, when the user is asked to enter Y or N when ordering another pizza. Both of these are single character inputs, so that's what my validation function will have to address.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>Iteriative decision for string validation:</h3>
                <p><b>Option 1:</b></p>
                <p>This is the more basic string validation function. Some positive points is that it can validate a long input as well as small inputs. When using it in my code I use 'option = get_string("Please enter an option: ->", 1,1)' so it can only be one string, this is a problem as it doesn't accept an input like "RR" when the customer clearly wants the review menu. Another letter not part of the valid answers like "Z" or a number will also be accepted as there is nothing in the function to stop it.</p>
                 <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/4o1.png" alt="This is option 1">    
                <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/4o11.png" alt="This is option 1">   
            
                <br>
                <p><b>Option 2:</b></p>
                <p>This is a more advanced validation function. Negatively, it can only validate inputs of one character. However, it is very flexible to the situation as I include a char_list as one of my arguments. Therefore when I use this function it will look like this -'option = get_one_string2("Please enter an option: ->", ["P", "O", "R", "Q"])'. This is a huge advantage because only P, O, R, Q will be accepted, making sure that if another letter like Z or a number to be entered, it will ask the user to reenter.</p>
                 <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/4o2.png" alt="This is option 2">    
                <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/4o21.png" alt="This is option 2">    
                
                
                <br>
                  <p><b>Evaluation:</b></p>
                <p>I chose to use option 2 because it is better suiting to the situations I have, which are both single inputs. At the moment I'm only trying to fix the problems at hand, if other situation occur where I need a string validation for a long string I will reassess. Option 2 fixes more errors that Option 1, e.g. RR will be accepted as R in Option 2 but it will not in Option1.</p

                    To fix this I added 'user_input = user_input[0]' into the validation function so the function will only take the first letter in the input.

                <p>A problem which I found is that the user can order the same pizza multiple times. This is an issue because instead the program should just add to original amount. In the image above we see how the customer was able to order the Cheese Pizza twice. I am adding this to  my backlog, it won't be placed at the top as it's not a prioity right not. It is clear that I need to add more basic functions to the program like a receipt function before I try and fix this duplicate problem.</p>
                
                
        <h3>Final Reflection:</h3>
            
<p>At the end, all the testing situation's I tested ended up without errors . I made sure to input a wide variety of inputs, expected as well as unexpted. The program retured the right error messages when the input was unexpected. You can see from the output screenshot, the function was working properly as error messages were justified and the program always ended up with a valid string.
                <br>
                I have learnt that validation functions are so important because they prevent many crashes as many things can go wrong when the user is asks to input something. I'm happy with this sprint as I sucessfully validated string inputs. I also found a problem in my code (duplicates occuring) which I will fix sometime in the future.</p>
