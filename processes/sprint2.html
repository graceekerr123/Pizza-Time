                <p> the indexes would start at 0 which is confusing for a standard human. </p>

            <p>If the user enters a quantity of 0 for a pizza, it programme allows this even when they aren't ordering anything.</p>

                <br>
            <p>When the user accidently enters a string instead of a integer, the programme crashes and no error message that tells the user what went wrongs comes up. </p>

                <p>The capitalisation of the pizza name is wrong. This is because this is incorrect English language.</p>

            <br><br>  
                <p>When the user enters enters in a wrong input (not 'y' or 'n') when asked if they would like to order another pizza, it automatically asks the user for a pizza index. This is a problem because if the user meant to enter 'n' then they will be forced to order more pizza's without an exit. Instead of the 'invalid entry' message coming up, it should've been repeated the question again to allow the user another chance to press the right key.

                <br>
                <p>When the user enters in a pizza index that isn't valid (too big or too small), the program doesn't return a error message and instead the program crashes.</p>
